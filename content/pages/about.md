# About
I am Sohom.

Professionally, I work with computers. I throw around the term "DevOps" and "Software Engineer" rather casually in my CV. Strictly speaking, I aim to be a **generalist**.

Personally, I enjoy learning things for the sake of learning things. I am a bit skewed towards STEM fields with an even bigger skew towards Computers.

> Life is best filled by learning as much as you can about as much as you can!

This quote seems like a good way to go about living life.

I find writing to be an excellent way of thinking. It _really_ helps me think clearly. Hence, this site/blog. This blog is my excuse to try out new ideas, to learn new things and to do it properly.

I also enjoy walking, cycling and trekking. I often go on long walks and take lots of photos of plants and other interesting things. I also do a teeny-tiny bit of photography. I also liking to visit crowded spaces and just observe people go about their usual days.

I enjoy my own company quite a lot and I read a small bit.
