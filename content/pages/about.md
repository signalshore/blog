# About
I am Sohom.

I like learning things, for the sake of learning things. That being said, my learning is a bit skewed towards computers and everything related to computer. Ultimate goal is to learn everything that goes into making a working computer.

I have found writing to be an excellent way to think. It _really_ helps me. I have personally learnt a __lot__ from other people's blogs/sites and with this blog I hope to help someone else.

This blog is my excuse to try out new ideas, to learn new things and
to do it properly.

I also enjoy walking, cycling and trekking. I often go on long walks and take lots of photos of plants and other things. I also do a teeny-tiny bit of photography. I also liking to visit crowded spaces and just observe people go about their usual days.
