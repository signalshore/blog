# About
I am Sohom.

Professionally, I work with computers. I throw around the term "DevOps" and "Software Engineer" rather casually in my CV. Strictly speaking, I aim to be a **generalist**. I like networks, distributed-systems and systems in general. The words are vague for a reason. I do not want to be specific. Being vague gives me a lot of space to explore.

Personally, I enjoy learning things for the sake of learning things. I am a bit skewed towards STEM fields with an even bigger skew towards Computers.

I find writing to be an excellent way of thinking. It _really_ helps me think clearly. Hence, this site. This is my excuse to try out new ideas, to learn new things and to do it properly.

This is **not** a blog. This is a live-record of things that I am doing. Nothing is *static*. Things **will** be updated regularly.

I also enjoy walking, cycling, and treks. I often go on long lazy walks and take lots of photos of plants and other interesting things. I do a teeny-tiny bit of photography too. Sometimes, I visit crowded spaces and just observe people go about their usual lives.

I enjoy my own company quite a lot and I read a fair bit.
